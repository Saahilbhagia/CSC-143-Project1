Hours Spent: 1 hour 30 minutes
Bonus Points Claimed: I have done the git orderly. Almost forgot when getting started!
Comments: A really good practice on inheritance, HashMap and HashSet. The use of Pair also helpful.
I also just learn about generic type when you can change any types for the instance. Forgot to mention
about for each loop, pretty safe. The math is still a bit easy, but balance.
